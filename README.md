# New Bank System OOP

## Overview

This project implements a basic bank system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Its aim is to simulate key banking operations–such as account management, customer profiles, transactions, and simple reporting–in a modular and extensible way.

## Features

- Customer registration and account creation
- Account types (e.g., savings, checking)
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Balance checks and transaction history
- Simple reporting (e.g., account summaries)
- Modular structure for easy extension

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: (Please update accordingly; e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Object-Oriented Principles
- CLI-based (or GUI if implemented)
